# Multilingual Technologies and Language Diversity

Instructor:  Prof. Smaranda Muresan and Dr. Isabelle Zaugg

Teaching assistant: Jonathan Reeve

Course Meeting Time: Fridays 10:10 AM – 12:40 PM

Office Hours: Smaranda Muresan, by appointment on Monday, 4-5pm

Isabelle Zaugg, by appointment on Monday and Thursday, 10-11am


## Short Description

Innovations in digital technologies have shown their potential to be at times breathtakingly beneficial, and at others divisive or troubling. With regard to digital technologies" impact on the ecosystem of language diversity, evidence suggests that new technologies are one contributor to the decline and predicted extinction of 50-90% of the world\'s languages this century. Yet digital innovations supporting a growing number of languages also have the potential to bolster language diversity in ways unimaginable a few years ago. Will innovations in multilingual natural language processing bring about a renaissance of language diversity, as users no longer need to rely on English and other dominant languages? To address this question, this course will introduce a dual view on language diversity: 1) a typology of language vitality and endangerment and 2) a resource-centric typology (low-resource vs. high-resource) regarding the availability of data resources to develop computational models for language analysis. This course will address the challenge of scaling natural language processing technologies developed mostly for English to the rich diversity of human languages. The resource-centric typology will also contribute to the dialogue of what is "Data Science." Much research has been dedicated to the "Big Data" scenario; however "Small Data" poses equally challenging problems, which this course will highlight. This course brings data and computational literacy about multilingual technologies to humanities students, while also exposing computer science and data science students to ethical, cultural, business, and policy issues within the context of multilingual technologies. 

This 4000-level course is cross-listed in the Department of Computer Science and the Institute for Comparative Literature and Society, and open to both upper-level undergraduate and graduate students. The class will also provide open source state-of-the-art NLP tools and datasets to be used by students and relevant readings. The final project will team up students in CS and ICLS.
 

## Academic Integrity

Columbia's intellectual community relies on academic integrity and responsibility as the cornerstone of its work. Graduate students are expected to exhibit the highest level of personal and academic honesty as they engage in scholarly discourse and research. In practical terms, you must be responsible for the full and accurate attribution of the ideas of others in all of your research papers and projects; you must be honest when taking your examinations; you must always submit your own work and not that of another student, scholar, or internet source. Graduate students are responsible for knowing and correctly utilizing referencing and bibliographical guidelines. When in doubt, consult your professor. Citation and plagiarism-prevention resources can be found at [the GSAS page on Academic Integrity and Responsible Conduct of Research]( http://gsas.columbia.edu/academic-integrity).

Failure to observe these rules of conduct will have serious academic consequences, up to and including dismissal from the university. If a faculty
member suspects a breach of academic honesty, appropriate investigative and
disciplinary action will be taken following [Dean's Discipline procedures](http://gsas.columbia.edu/content/disciplinary-procedures).

## Disabilities Accommodations

If you have been certified by Disability Services (DS) to
receive accommodations, please either bring your accommodation letter from DS
to your professor"s office hours to confirm your accommodation needs, or ask
your liaison in GSAS to consult with your professor.  If you believe that
you may have a disability that requires accommodation, please contact [Disability Services](http://health.columbia.edu/disability-services) at 212-854-2388 or **disability@columbia.edu**.

Important: To request and receive an accommodation you must be certified by DS.

**April 2**. **ISABELLE:**  What is the "clash of values" when it comes to "global language justice?"**   Students each present 2-3 minutes on the digital stakeholder they chose last week, their mission statement or agenda, and how that intersects with support for language diversity.  If extra time remains, students are divided into teams and compete in a class debate about the ideal relationship between multilingual technologies and language diversity.  Check-in on final projects.

12.  April 9. ISABELLE & SMARA**:**  **Final Project Presentations (last day of class): ** Students present their final projects in a festive setting (organized as a poster session).  Final paper, including the computational project and an essay tying project together with themes in the course, is due a week after the end of class, April 16.
